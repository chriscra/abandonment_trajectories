\caption{\label{fig:global-map}The locations of our 11 sites, from (1).}
\end{figure}

Cropland abandonment at individual sites ranged between 314,374.8 ha (Shaanxi) and 930,424 ha (Orenburg) as of 2017 (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}), and because our sites varied in size, this corresponded to between 7.91\% (Nebraska) and 19.91\% (Shaanxi) of the total area of each site (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-panel}).

We report the standard deviation of mean abandonment durations across our 11 sites (1.52 years).
We also calculated the mean standard deviation of abandonment durations across our sites, which was 7.78 years.
The former is a measure of spread of mean abandonment lengths across the 11 sites, whereas the later is a measure of the average spread of abandonment lengths at each site.

The area abandoned at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-panel}.
Area by land cover class is shown for each site in Figure \ref{fig:area-by-lc}, and the area abandoned is shared by age class in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}.

We also find that a significant area of abandoned croplands were recultivated by the end of our time series (Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}).

The timing of abandonment varied across sites (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}), with some sites showing more abandonment earlier in the time series (e.g.~Iraq; Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Volgograd, Russia; Nebraska/Wyoming, USA; \& Mato Grosso, Brazil), some showing consistent abandonment over time (e.g.~Vitebsk, Belarus/Smolensk, Russia; Goiás, Brazil; and Wisconsin, USA), and others showing abandonment increasing later in the time series (e.g.~sites in Shaanxi/Shanxi and Chongqing, China).

\hypertarget{mato-grosso}{%
\subsection{Limited abandonment at Mato Grosso}\label{mato-grosso}}

Mato Grosso was the only site that did not experience significant amounts of cropland abandonment during our time series; unsurprising given the recent history of agriculturally-drive land-use change over the last few decades.
As a result, we interpret the trends we see in Mato Grosso regarding abandonment persistence and decay with caution.\\
Mato Grosso also showed relatively more durable abandonment, requiring 25 years to decline by half and 110 years for complete turnover.
However, because Mato Grosso showed large amounts of new cultivation over the source of our time series and relatively little abandonment (9,006 ha, or 0.47\% of total site area, as of 2017), these results should be interpreted with care.

\hypertarget{biomes}{%
\subsection{Biomes}\label{biomes}}

Some ecosystems and biomes seem to recover more quickly and successfully than others, namely in relatively higher latitudes, relatively colder climates, and in relatively more humid biomes (2).
Our sites cover a range of biomes, including Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests (Vitebsk Belarus/Smolensk, Russia; Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Wisconsin, USA), Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands (Nebraska/Wyoming, USA; Orenburg, Russia/Oral, Kazakhstan; Volgograd, Russia), and Tropical Grassland (Goiás and Mato Grosso, Brazil), Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (Chongqing, China; Mato Grosso, Brazil), Montane Grassland and Shrublands (Shaanxi/Shanxi, China), and Deserts \& Xeric Shrublands (Iraq) (Figure \ref{fig:site-biomes}).
Land cover outcomes for abandoned croplands showed wide variation across sites, with most abandonment in Wisconsin being classified as forest by 2017 (60\% forest, 40\% grassland), but remaining mostly in grassland elsewhere (Figure \ref{fig:abn-prop-lc}).
This limited woody vegetation regrowth may be a product of the biome or simply insufficient time for woody biomass to develop, and land cover alone cannot confidently serve as a proxy for ecosystem recovery.

\hypertarget{abn-thresholds}{%
\subsection{The effect of varying abandonment definitions}\label{abn-thresholds}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Abandonment threshold, including a higher threshold (something like 6 or 10 years), along with how thresholds change total pixels/area.
\end{itemize}

A relatively short-term definition of abandonment might result in an overestimation of recultivation, because short term abandonment may be better understood as cyclical fallow periods, not true abandonment.
Because fallow periods may vary around the world, we tested multiple abandonment thresholds, and mean abandonment duration across our sites increased accordingly, ranging between 7 (no threshold) and 19 (10 years) years.
The proportion of abandoned croplands that were recultivated by the end of the time series also responded to our abandonment threshold, but even at the longest abandonment definition (10 years), we still saw that between 10 and 30\% of abandoned croplands were recultivated by the end of the time series.
This indicates that the abandonment and recultivation we observe is not merely a function of our five year abandonment definition.



\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=47.22in]{/Users/christophercrawford/Google_Drive/_Projects/abandonment_trajectories/output/plots/_2021_03_13/mean_lengths_by_threshold_2021_03_13} \caption{Mean abandonment lengths shown for various abandonment thresholds.}\label{fig:abn-thresholds-mean-duration}
\end{figure}

Like the mean duration of abandonment, the amount of recultivation depends on our definition of abandonment (Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}). We find that the mean area of abandoned croplands that get recultivated by the end of the time series declines from 37.77\% with a 5 year threshold to 30.93\% with a 7 year threshold, and 22.83\% with a 10 year threshold.

\hypertarget{twoyr-vs-annual}{%
\subsection{Comparing our annual identification of abandonment with a two-year method}\label{twoyr-vs-annual}}

In order to understand the potential for an over- or under-estimation of abandonment when using a shorter time-series or two snapshots in time, we used our land cover maps to simply identify those areas identified as cropland in 1987 that are not cropland in 2017.

\hypertarget{methods-si}{%
\section{Extended Methods}\label{methods-si}}

As previously noted, we build on annual land cover maps for 1987-2017 developed by (1).
The following supplement outlines our methodological steps in more specific detail than was possible in the main text.
We processed and analyzed our abandonment map data in RStudio version 1.4.1717 (5), using R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18), relying heavily on the \texttt{raster} (6), \texttt{terra} (7), \texttt{data.table} (8), and \texttt{tidyverse} (9) packages.

\hypertarget{classifying-abandonment}{%
\subsection{Classifying abandonment}\label{classifying-abandonment}}

Pixels that remained in cropland or non-cropland classes throughout the entire time series were excluded, as were periods of non-cropland that began in the first year of the time series, even if that pixel was later classified as cropland and subsequently abandoned (leaving only periods of abandonment that we could verify had followed agricultural activity during our time series).

As noted, pixels that transitioned from cropland to the non-vegetation class were not considered ``abandoned,'' and therefore we excluded all non-vegetation pixels from our analysis.
These pixels represent a very small portion of our dataset, and non-vegetated land remained about constant or declined over time at most sites.
See Figure \ref{fig:area-by-lc}.

Restricting the mean abandonment duration to account for only those pixels that are both abandoned and recultivated within the time series would exclude a large portion of our data, and may underestimate the eventual lengths of many periods of abandonment that begin close to the end of our time series.
(Note: assessing temporal changes in mean length abandoned would involve looking at the mean length of time abandoned at each year of Figure \ref{fig:panel-s}a).

All area calculations were performed using the \texttt{raster::area()} function.

\hypertarget{temporal-filters}{%
\subsection{Temporal filters}\label{temporal-filters}}

In order to address potential classification errors in a single year, we implemented a series of temporal filters intended to smooth the trajectories in our time series by looking for short-term land-cover changes that are temporally unlikely.
We applied five-year and eight-year moving window filters designed to search for short periods of land cover classifications that do not match those immediately before and after, and subsequently update them to match the surrounding classifications.
Specifically, the five-year filter searched for one year periods that did not match the two years immediately before and after (i.e.~patterns of 11011, where 1 represents non-cropland and 0 represents cropland), and our eight-year filter searched for two year periods that did not match the three years before and after (i.e.~11100111).
The central classifications were then updated to match the classes on either end.
We also considered applying modified versions of these moving window filters to the start of the time series, but decided against it, for the sake of consistency and parsimony.

\hypertarget{decay-models-si}{%
\subsection{Modeling abandonment decay}\label{decay-models-si}}

The mean abandonment duration tells us about the general persistence of abandoned croplands throughout the time series.
However, this value is limited by the time series length, and does not account for when the majority of the abandonment took place at a site, nor whether a period of abandonment ends as a results of recultivation or the end of the time series.
As a result, the mean abandonment duration does not tell us how long to expect a piece of land to remain abandoned, nor how abandonment length varies through time.
To address this constraint, we track the trajectory of each pixel through time following its initial abandonment, grouping pixels abandoned in a given year into ``cohorts.''

Decay rates provide information about how long it takes for land to be recultivated, complementing the mean abandonment length and providing a more nuanced story about how long to expect abandonment to last.

For example, a site may have a relatively short mean length of abandonment (e.g.~Shaanxi/Shanxi {[}China{]}, with a mean abandonment length of 13 years; see Figure \ref{fig:maps-abn-duration}), but also have a gradual decay rate, indicating that land should stay abandoned for a relatively longer amount of time.
This may result from more abandonment occurring towards the end of the time series; this land simply does not have as long to age and shows up as younger in our data, regardless of how long it may last.

Looking at abandonment decay rates for each cohort individually allows us to produce a decay rate for each site in general in a way that accounts for when during the time series a piece of land was abandoned (i.e.~giving us a sense of how long to expect a given piece of land to remain abandoned, even into the future).

(Note: the following three sentences may be redundant.)
For example, imagine two fields, one abandoned in 1990 and the other abandoned in 2010.
They may both end up remaining abandoned for 15 years, but the second field will show up as having an age of 7 at the end of our time series (which ends in 2017), regardless of how long it lasts.
One way we could deal with this is to only look at land that was affirmatively recultivated; another is to look at decay rates for each cohort, over time.

\hypertarget{model-selection-and-diagnostics}{%
\subsubsection{Model selection and diagnostics}\label{model-selection-and-diagnostics}}

We then ran linear models (using the \texttt{stats::lm()} function in R's core statistics package), predicting the proportion of abandoned cropland in each cohort remaining abandoned as a function of time since initial abandonment.
We tested a range of model specifications, including linear and log transformations of both \emph{proportion} and \emph{time}.
Importantly, we also include \emph{cohort} fixed effects, allowing for the estimation of unique coefficients for each cohort of abandoned land.
Due to a linear relationship between model residuals and time when including only one term for \emph{time}, we also tested models containing multiple \emph{time} predictor terms, including both log and linear terms.

We chose a model with the following specifications shown in Equation \eqref{eq:mod-spec-SI}.
For cohorts of abandonment initially abandoned in years \(y = 1988 ... 2013\), we estimate the proportion \(p\) of each cohort \(y\) remaining abandoned as a function of time \(t\) (i.e.~based on the number of years after initial abandonment).

\begin{equation}
p_{y} = 1 + \beta_{1,y} log(t + 1) + \beta_{2,y} t \label{eq:mod-spec-SI}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,y}\) represents the regression coefficient on the log term of time \(t\) for cohort \(y\), and \(\beta_{2,y}\) represents the regression coefficient on the linear term of time \(t\) for cohort \(y\).
We allow for site and cohort level fixed effects, fitting unique coefficients for each cohort at each site.

This corresponds to a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ I(proportion\ -\ 1)\ \ \textasciitilde{}\ 0\ +\ log(time\ +\ 1):cohort:site\ +\ I(time):cohort:site)}

Model selection was done based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values (Figure \ref{fig:AIC}).
We checked linear model assumptions through visual inspection of both residuals vs.~fitted plots (Figure \ref{fig:diag-resid-fitted}) and Q-Q plots (Figure \ref{fig:diag-qq}).

\hypertarget{section-methods-rate-of-change}{%
\subsection{Change in recultivation rates over time}\label{section-methods-rate-of-change}}

We examined the rate of change of recultivation rates by calculating the time required for 50\% of each cohort to be recultivated and running a simple linear regression on these values as a function of time, using the \texttt{stats::lm()} function in R's core statistics package.
We estimate the time required for half (50\%) of a given cohort of abandoned cropland to be recultivated, \(t_{half,s}\), as a function of the year of initial abandonment (\(yearabn_{s}\)), at each site \(s\).
This model is shown in Equation \eqref{eq:rate-of-change-lm}.

\begin{equation}
t_{half,s} = \beta_{0,s} + \beta_{1,s} yearabn_{s} \label{eq:rate-of-change-lm}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,s}\) represents the regression slope on the year abandoned for site \(s\) (\(yearabn_{s}\)), and \(\beta_{0,s}\) represents the intercept.
This corresponds to a \texttt{lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ t\_half\ \textasciitilde{}\ year\_abandoned)} run for each site individually.
Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-rate-of-change}.

We confirmed that model assumptions were met through visual inspection of residuals vs.~fitted plots (Figure \ref{fig:rate-of-change-diag-resid-fitted}) and Q-Q plots (Figure \ref{fig:rate-of-change-diag-qq}).

\subsubsection{Alternative assumptions about annual additional abandonment}\label{alternative-assumptions-about-annual-additional-abandonment}}

As noted above, we make two simple assumptions in our extrapolation of abandonment and recultivation: specifically, that 1) recultivation rates remain the same (based on mean recultivation trends at each site, shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-curves-by-site}, and that 2) a constant amount of cropland is newly abandoned each year, based on the mean annual gain in abandonment shown in Figure \ref{fig:turnover-grid} (dark green bars).

However, the second assumption, that a constant amount of cropland is newly abandoned indefinitely is almost certainly unrealistic.
We also considered an alternative assumption, in which annual abandonment linearly declined to 0 between 2017 and 2050 (see Figures \ref{fig:extrapolation2-combo} and \ref{fig:extrapolation2-area-by-age}).
While mean age of abandoned land increased through time after 2017 (and most dramatically after 2050), it remained below 37 years at all sites by 2050.
Increases in mean abandonment duration were offset by recultivation, and total area abandoned declined quickly after 2020 at most sites.

The mean abandonment duration increases as annual abandonment declines, as the total pool of abandoned land grows older and is gradually recultivated.
