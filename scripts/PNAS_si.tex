\section{Extended Results}\label{results-si}}

Cropland abandonment at individual sites (excluding Mato Grosso, see Section S1.A.) ranged between 314,374.8 ha (Shaanxi) and 930,424 ha (Orenburg) as of 2017 (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}), and because our sites varied in size, this corresponded to between 7.91\% (Nebraska) and 19.91\% (Shaanxi) of the total area of each site (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-panel}).

On average, we found that cropland abandonment lasted for only 14.42 years (SD = 1.52 years) across our time series at our eleven sites.
Note, however, that these summary statistics are calculated based on the mean abandonment duration at each site, to account for different site sizes.
The summary statistics reported are therefore the mean of the mean abandonment duration at each of our eleven sites, and the standard deviation of the mean abandonment duration at each of our eleven sites.

We also calculated the mean standard deviation of abandonment duration across our sites, which was 7.78 years.
The former is a measure of the spread of mean abandonment lengths across the 11 sites, whereas the latter is a measure of the average spread of abandonment lengths at each site.
See Table \ref{tab:summary-stats-table}.

The area abandoned at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-panel} (see also Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table}).
The area abandoned at each site, by age class, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}, and the area in each land cover class at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-by-lc}.
Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class} shows that the timing of abandonment varied across sites; some sites showed more abandonment earlier in the time series (e.g., Iraq; Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Volgograd, Russia; Nebraska/Wyoming, USA; \& Mato Grosso, Brazil), some showed consistent abandonment over time (e.g., Vitebsk, Belarus/Smolensk, Russia; Goiás, Brazil; and Wisconsin, USA), and others showed increasing abandonment later on in the time series (e.g., sites in Shaanxi/Shanxi and Chongqing, China).
Furthermore, Figure \ref{fig:turnover-grid} shows the annual gain, loss, and net change in the area of abandoned croplands abandoned at each site.

\hypertarget{mato-grosso}{%
\subsection{Limited abandonment in Mato Grosso}\label{mato-grosso}}

Mato Grosso, Brazil, was the only site that did not experience significant amounts of cropland abandonment during our time series.
This is unsurprising given the recent history of agriculturally-driven land-use change over the last few decades.
That being said, the abandonment that did take place in Mato Grosso was relatively more durable, requiring 25 years to decline by half and 110 years for complete turnover.
However, because Mato Grosso showed large amounts of new cultivation over the source of our time series and relatively little abandonment (9,006 ha, or 0.47\% of the total cropland extent, as of 2017), these results should be interpreted with care.

\hypertarget{biomes}{%
\subsection{Biomes}\label{biomes}}

Some ecosystems and biomes seem to recover more quickly than others, namely in relatively higher latitudes, relatively colder climates, and in relatively more humid biomes (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Prach2018}{1}).
Our sites cover a range of biomes (Figure \ref{fig:site-biomes}), including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests (Vitebsk Belarus/Smolensk, Russia; Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Wisconsin, USA),
\item
  Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands (Nebraska/Wyoming, USA; Orenburg, Russia/Uralsk, Kazakhstan; Volgograd, Russia),
\item
  Tropical Grassland (Goiás and Mato Grosso, Brazil),
\item
  Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (Chongqing, China; Mato Grosso, Brazil),
\item
  Montane Grassland and Shrublands (Shaanxi/Shanxi, China), and
\item
  Deserts \& Xeric Shrublands (Iraq).
\end{itemize}

The long-term land-cover outcomes for abandoned croplands are shown (as of 2017) in Figure \ref{fig:abn-prop-lc}.
Land cover outcomes for abandoned croplands showed wide variation across sites, with most abandonment in Wisconsin being classified as forest by 2017 (60\% forest, 40\% grassland), but remaining mostly in grassland elsewhere (Figure \ref{fig:abn-prop-lc}).
This limited woody vegetation regrowth may be a product of the biome, but it may simply be a result of insufficient time for woody biomass to develop.
Land cover alone cannot confidently serve as a proxy for ecosystem recovery.

\hypertarget{abn-thresholds}{%
\subsection{The effect of varying abandonment definitions}\label{abn-thresholds}}

A relatively short-term definition of abandonment might result in an overestimation of recultivation, because short-term abandonment may be better understood as cyclical fallow periods, not true abandonment (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Munroe2013}{2}).
Because typical fallow period length may vary around the world, we tested multiple abandonment thresholds in order to test the sensitivity of our results to our choice of a five-year abandonment definition, following the FAO (\protect\hyperlink{ref-FAO2016}{3}).
As our abandonment threshold increased in length, the mean abandonment duration across our sites increased accordingly, ranging between 7 years (no threshold) and 19 years (10-year threshold).
As expected, using a longer abandonment definition reduced the amount of cropland abandonment we detected, which is also shown in the area in the different colored age classes in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}.

The proportion of abandoned croplands that were recultivated by the end of the time series also responded to our abandonment threshold, with less recultivation for longer abandonment thresholds (Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}).
However, even at the longest abandonment definition (10 years), we still saw that between 10\% and 30\% of abandoned croplands were recultivated by the end of the time series.
We find that the mean area of abandoned croplands that get recultivated by the end of the time series declines from 37.77\% with a 5 year threshold to 30.93\% with a 7 year threshold, and 22.83\% with a 10 year threshold.
This indicates that the abandonment and recultivation we observe is not merely a function of our five-year abandonment definition.

\hypertarget{twoyr-vs-annual}{%
\subsection{Comparing annual and two-year estimates of abandonment}\label{twoyr-vs-annual}}

Some studies estimate cropland abandonment by simply looking for areas where land cover is classified as ``cultivated'' in one year, but not in a later year (e.g., 1992 and 2015 in ref. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Naess2021}{4})).
In order to understand the magnitude of the differences that could result from using this two-year approach, we estimated cropland abandonment by simply identifying areas that were classified as ``cropland'' in 1987 and classified as either ``woody vegetation'' or ``herbaceous vegetation'' in 2017 (i.e., excluding ``non-vegetation'').

Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table} shows the area of abandoned croplands as identified using a five-year abandonment definition and the full annual time series (Column 2), and the area of abandoned croplands identified using only the difference between 2017 and 1987 (Column 3).
These two methods produced abandonment area estimates that ranged between 39.75\% lower (Goiás, Brazil) and 83.29\% higher (Mato Grosso, Brazil) than the abandoned area identified using the full time series.

Not only do these methods produce different area estimates, but they also differ in the location of the abandonment they identify, with spatial agreement of only 28.08\% (Mato Grosso, Brazil) to 66.3\% (Bosnia \& Herzegovina) (see Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table}).
We measure spatial agreement using the Jaccard similarity index {[}Legendre2012{]}, a measure of overlap between two sets, defined as the proportion of shared elements, or the intersection divided by the union (Equation \eqref{eq:jaccard-equation}) (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Legendre2012}{5}):

\begin{equation}
J(a,b) = \frac{a\cap b}{a\cup b} \label{eq:jaccard-equation}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{maps-of-abandonment-duration-as-of-2017-and-maximum-duration-during-time-series}{%
\subsection{Maps of abandonment duration as of 2017 and maximum duration during time series}\label{maps-of-abandonment-duration-as-of-2017-and-maximum-duration-during-time-series}}

As described in the main text, because a pixel may be abandoned and recultivated multiple times throughout the time series, we calculated the mean abandonment duration in two ways: 1) across all periods of abandonment (as shown in Figure 2), and 2) across only the longest period of abandonment experienced by each pixel.
Maps of the maximum abandonment duration at each pixel at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps-max-abn-duration} (serving as a companion to Figure 1).
The distribution of maximum duration values, and the corresponding mean maximum duration value at each site, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mean-abn-duration-w-max} (serving as a companion to Figure 2).

Expanded site-specific results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:panel-b}-\ref{fig:panel-w}.

\hypertarget{methods-si}{%
\section{Extended Methods}\label{methods-si}}

As noted in our main text, we build on annual land cover maps for 1987-2017 developed by Yin et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Yin2020}{6}).
The following section outlines our data processing and analytical methods in more specific detail than was possible in the main text.
We processed and analyzed our abandonment map data in RStudio version 1.4.1717 (\protect\hyperlink{ref-RStudio}{7}), using R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18), relying heavily on the \texttt{\{raster\}} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-R-raster}{8}), \texttt{\{terra\}} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-R-terra}{9}), \texttt{\{data.table\}} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-R-data.table}{10}), and \texttt{\{tidyverse\}} (\protect\hyperlink{ref-R-tidyverse}{11}) packages.

\hypertarget{classifying-abandonment}{%
\subsection{Classifying abandonment}\label{classifying-abandonment}}

Pixels that remained in cropland or non-cropland classes throughout the entire time series were excluded, as were periods of non-cropland that began in the first year of the time series, even if that pixel was later classified as cropland and subsequently abandoned.
In effect, we only counted periods of abandonment that we could verify had followed agricultural activity during our time series.

As noted, pixels that transitioned from cropland to the non-vegetation land cover class were not considered ``abandoned,'' and therefore we excluded all non-vegetation pixels from our entire analysis.
These pixels accounted for \textless10\% of total site area at all sites except Shaanxi (12.7\%) and Iraq (52.8\%), and remained stable or declined over time at all eleven sites (see Figure \ref{fig:area-by-lc}).

All area calculations were performed using the \texttt{\{terra\}} package's \texttt{cellSize()} function, which calculates the spherical area of each cell as defined by its four corners (\protect\hyperlink{ref-R-terra}{9}).

\hypertarget{temporal-filters}{%
\subsection{Temporal filters}\label{temporal-filters}}

In order to address potential classification errors in a single year, we implemented a series of temporal filters designed to smooth trajectories by looking for short-term land-cover changes that are temporally unlikely.
We applied five-year and eight-year moving-window filters that searched for short periods of land cover classifications that do not match those immediately before and after, and subsequently updated them to match the surrounding classifications.
Specifically, the five-year filter searched for one year periods that did not match the two years immediately before and after (i.e., patterns of \texttt{11011}, where \texttt{1} represents non-cropland and \texttt{0} represents cropland), and our eight-year filter searched for two year periods that did not match the three years before and after (i.e., \texttt{11100111}).
The central classifications were then updated to match the classes on either end.

\hypertarget{decay-models-si}{%
\subsection{Modeling abandonment decay}\label{decay-models-si}}

Our mean abandonment duration metric tells us about the general persistence of abandoned croplands throughout the time series.
However, this value is limited by the time series length, and does not account for when the majority of the abandonment took place at a site, nor whether a period of abandonment ends as a results of recultivation or the end of the time series.
As a result, the mean abandonment duration does not tell us how long to expect a piece of land to remain abandoned, nor how abandonment length varies through time.
To address this constraint, we track the trajectory of each pixel through time following its initial abandonment, grouping pixels abandoned in a given year into ``cohorts.'' Decay rates provide information about how long it takes for land to be recultivated, complementing the mean abandonment length and providing a more nuanced story about how long to expect abandonment to last.

For example, a site may have a relatively short mean length of abandonment (e.g., Shaanxi/Shanxi {[}China{]}, with a mean abandonment length of 13 years; see Figure 1), but also have a gradual decay rate, indicating that land should stay abandoned for a relatively longer amount of time.
This may result from more abandonment occurring towards the end of the time series; this land simply does not have as long to age and shows up as younger in our data, regardless of how long it may last.
Looking at abandonment decay rates for each cohort individually allows us to produce a decay rate for each site in general in a way that accounts for when during the time series a piece of land was abandoned (i.e., giving us a sense of how long to expect a given piece of land to remain abandoned, even into the future).

\hypertarget{model-selection-and-diagnostics}{%
\subsubsection{Model selection and diagnostics}\label{model-selection-and-diagnostics}}

We fit linear models using the \texttt{lm()} function in R's core statistics package \texttt{\{stats\}}, predicting the proportion of abandoned cropland in each cohort remaining abandoned as a function of time since initial abandonment at each site.
The proportion of abandoned cropland remaining abandoned is measured relative to the area abandoned 5 years following the year of initial abandonment, as dictated by our five year abandonment definition.

We tested a range of model specifications, including linear and log transformations of both \emph{proportion} and \emph{time}.
Due to a linear relationship between model residuals and time when including only one term for \emph{time}, we also tested models containing multiple \emph{time} predictor terms, including both log and linear terms.

We chose a model with the following specifications shown in Equation 1 and reproduced here in Equation \eqref{eq:mod-spec-SI}.
For cohorts of abandonment initially abandoned in years \(y = 1988, ... , 2013\), we estimate the proportion \(p\) of each cohort \(y\) remaining abandoned as a function of time \(t\) (i.e., based on the number of years after initial abandonment).

\begin{equation}
p_{y} = 1 + \beta_{1,y} log(t + 1) + \beta_{2,y} t \label{eq:mod-spec-SI}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,y}\) represents the regression coefficient on the log term of time \(t\) for cohort \(y\), and \(\beta_{2,y}\) represents the regression coefficient on the linear term of time \(t\) for cohort \(y\).
We allow for \emph{cohort} level fixed effects, fitting unique coefficients for each cohort at each site.
We ran individual models for each site, using a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ I(proportion\ -\ 1)\ \ \textasciitilde{}\ 0\ +\ log(time\ +\ 1):cohort\ +\ I(time):cohort)} on data for only that site.
Taken together, these 11 models are correspond to a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ I(proportion\ -\ 1)\ \ \textasciitilde{}\ 0\ +\ log(time\ +\ 1):cohort:site\ +\ I(time):cohort:site)}.

Model selection was performed based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values (Figure \ref{fig:AIC}), selecting the model with the lowest (i.e., more negative) AIC value.
We confirmed that linear model assumptions were not violated through visual inspection of both residuals vs.~fitted plots (Figure \ref{fig:diag-resid-fitted}) and Q-Q plots (Figure \ref{fig:diag-qq}).

\hypertarget{recultivation-decay-model-results}{%
\subsubsection{Recultivation (``decay'') model results}\label{recultivation-decay-model-results}}

The observed data, fitted values from these linear models, and mean decay rates for each site, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-model-grid}.

In order to calculate the mean decay trajectory at each site (as shown in Figure 3), we took the mean of the log coefficients (\(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\)) and the linear coefficients (\(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\)) respectively across all cohorts \(y\) at each site.
These mean values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-mod-coef}.
We then used these mean coefficient values (\(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\) and \(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\)) to define a new function describing the mean recultivation (or decay) trajectory at each site, using the same for as Equation \eqref{eq:mod-spec-SI}.

An alternative representation of the mean recultivation rate is shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-time-to-range}.

\hypertarget{section-methods-rate-of-change}{%
\subsection{Change in recultivation rates over time}\label{section-methods-rate-of-change}}

We examined the rate of change of recultivation rates by calculating the half-life, \(t_{half,s}\), defined as the time required for half (50\%) of a given cohort of abandoned cropland to be recultivated, and parameterizing a simple linear model on these half-life values as a function of time, using the \texttt{stats::lm()} function in R's core statistics package \texttt{\{stats\}}.
We estimate the half-life, \(t_{half,s}\), as a function of the year of initial abandonment (\(yearabn_{s}\)), at each site \(s\), as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:rate-of-change-lm}.

\begin{equation}
t_{half,s} = \beta_{0,s} + \beta_{1,s} yearabn_{s} \label{eq:rate-of-change-lm}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,s}\) represents the regression slope on the year abandoned (cohort) for site \(s\) (\(yearabn_{s}\)), and \(\beta_{0,s}\) represents the intercept.
This corresponds to a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ t\_half\ \textasciitilde{}\ year\_abandoned)}, run for each site individually.
Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-rate-of-change}.

We confirmed that model assumptions were met through visual inspection of residuals vs.~fitted plots (Figure \ref{fig:rate-of-change-diag-resid-fitted}) and Q-Q plots (Figure \ref{fig:rate-of-change-diag-qq}).

\hypertarget{section-extrapolation-si}{%
\subsection{Projecting abandonment duration into the future}\label{section-extrapolation-si}}

The results of the projection highlighted in the main text (referred to here as ``Extrapolation 1'') are shown in Figure \ref{fig:extrapolation-combo} and Figure \ref{fig:extrapolation-area-by-age}.
As noted in the main text, we make two simple assumptions in our projection of abandonment and recultivation into the future: specifically, that 1) recultivation rates remain the same (based on mean recultivation trends at each site, shown in Figure 3, and that 2) a constant amount of cropland is newly abandoned each year, based on the mean annual gain in abandonment shown in Figure \ref{fig:annual-gain-trend}b (note: the annual gain in abandonment in Figure \ref{fig:annual-gain-trend}a corresponds to the dark green bars in Figure \ref{fig:turnover-grid}).

Given that abandonment may not continue indefinitely, we also explore an alternative to our second assumption about the amount of additional abandonment each year.
In this alternative assumption (``Extrapolation 2''), the area abandoned each year is the same as ``Extrapolation 1'' from 1987-2017, based on the mean annual gain in abandonment (Figure \ref{fig:annual-gain-trend}b), but linearly declines between 2017-2050, reaching 0 ha at each site in 2050 (see Figures \ref{fig:extrapolation2-combo} and \ref{fig:extrapolation2-area-by-age}).

While mean age of abandoned land increased through time after 2017 (and most dramatically after 2050), it remained below 37 years at all sites by 2050.
Increases in mean abandonment duration were offset by recultivation, and total area abandoned declined quickly after 2020 at most sites.
The mean abandonment duration increases as annual abandonment declines, as the total pool of abandoned land grows older and is gradually recultivated.
