\significancestatement{Demographic, economic, and environmental changes often cause cropland abandonment. While sometimes a threat to food security and cultural landscapes, abandonment also provides a vast opportunity for carbon sequestration and habitat restoration. However, those environmental benefits depend on how long ecosystems are allowed to regenerate and accumulate carbon and biodiversity following abandonment. Existing studies have often relied on single snapshots in time to estimate abandonment, and ignore recultivation. Using annual land-cover maps, we tracked abandonment and recultivation at eleven sites across four continents. Abandonment was short-lived, with most abandoned croplands being recultivated within three decades. Unless policymakers take steps to reduce recultivation or provide incentives for regeneration, abandonment will remain a missed opportunity to reduce biodiversity loss and climate change.}

\begin{abstract}
Agricultural expansion is a major cause of land-use change globally, yet tens of millions of hectares of cropland have been abandoned since 1950 due to demographic, economic, and environmental changes. These abandoned croplands could be valuable for carbon sequestration and biodiversity restoration. However, their environmental value depends on the duration and persistence of abandonment, which is poorly known. Here, we quantify the duration and persistence of cropland abandonment at eleven sites on four continents using 30-m annual land cover maps for the years 1987 through 2017. We find that abandonment is generally fleeting, lasting on average only 14.42 years (SD = 1.52). At most sites, we project that \textgreater50\% of abandoned croplands will be recultivated within 25 years, and sites in Eastern Europe, Russia, and the US show accelerating rates of recultivation. If current rates of abandonment and recultivation continue, the mean duration of abandonment at most sites will plateau between 10 and 22.3 years by 2040. Counter to optimistic assumptions, most abandonment is unlikely to be permanent and will produce limited benefits for carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. New policies and incentives are needed to lengthen the period of abandonment in order to generate such benefits. Until then, abandoned croplands will remain an untapped opportunity.

Human populations are in flux around the world, as people seek new economic opportunities in cities and flee changing environments and conflicts (1).
Coupled with environmental degradation and changing agricultural technologies, urbanization and rural outmigration have contributed to decreasing economic viability of many agricultural lands and a growing global trend of cropland abandonment (2, 3).
Given increasing competition for land, these abandoned croplands have been targeted for diverse goals such as biofuel production (4), carbon sequestration (5, 6), biodiversity and ecosystem restoration (7--9), or simply recultivation (10).

Millions of hectares of agricultural lands have been abandoned since 1950 (11), with abandonment predicted to continue in many places (1, 12), but for how long and to what end remains unclear.
Understanding the environmental effects of agricultural abandonment requires detailed information on not only where and when abandonment takes place, but also on what happens to croplands after they are abandoned.
In order for abandoned lands to yield environmental benefits, these lands must stay abandoned long enough to acquire appreciable gains in both plant biomass and the species that make up intact ecological communities.
It can take many decades to approach the levels of carbon sequestration or biodiversity typical of many intact ecosystems, with species recolonizing at different successional stages (13--19).
Knowing how long abandonment persists is thus critical to understanding its potential to help mitigate the ongoing climate and biodiversity crises.

Until recently, it has been difficult to gather detailed information on abandonment.
Many estimates of abandonment are inferred by aggregating regional estimates of cultivation, such as country-level FAO data on cultivated areas (15, 20).
When derived from satellite imagery, abandonment is most frequently estimated by simply taking the difference in cultivated area between land cover maps for two time points (e.g., 1992 and 2015, ref. 4).
Annual land-cover time series are becoming more common, but are typically limited to a few years (e.g., 2-12 years, refs. 21--23) or are coarse in resolution (e.g., \(\geq250\)-m, refs. 4 and 22), and most analyses are restricted to a single region (24).
These approaches all lack the spatial and temporal detail needed to understand long-term outcomes for individual croplands.
By failing to capture the dynamic patterns of abandonment and recultivation, scientists may substantially overestimate abandonment and the potential for associated benefits (25).

Empirical evidence for secondary forests in the Neotropics shows that forest regeneration is often short-lived (26--29).
For example, in the Brazilian Amazon, half of secondary forests were recleared in 5 to 8 years (6, 27, 30), and in southern Costa Rica in \(\leq20\) years (26).
However, estimates based on the growth of woody vegetation miss abandonment in earlier stages of regeneration and in biomes where succession does not lead to woody vegetation (25).

Site locations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:global-map}, and maps of maximum abandonment duration are shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps-max-abn-duration}.}\label{fig:maps-abn-duration}
\end{figure*}

Recent advances in remote sensing have made it possible to produce maps of cropland abandonment at both high spatial and temporal resolution.
Yin et al. (25) used a trajectory-based approach to produce accurate maps of annual cropland abandonment at 30-m resolution from 1987 to 2017 without relying on woody revegetation as a proxy of abandonment, thereby allowing for a direct measurement of abandonment in both forest and non-forest biomes.
Here, we utilize these new annual time-series of cropland abandonment (25) to investigate the duration and persistence of abandonment at eleven sites across four continents, including in Brazil, the United States, Eastern Europe, Russia, the Middle East, and China (Figure \ref{fig:maps-abn-duration}).

We address three questions: How long does abandoned cropland stay abandoned (i.e., duration of abandonment), and how does this vary geographically?
How quickly is abandoned land recultivated (i.e., persistence of abandonment), and do recultivation (or ``decay'') rates vary through time?
Finally, if abandonment and recultivation continue at current rates, what will ultimately be the mean age of abandoned croplands?

By making use of new, more accurate, and finer resolution abandonment maps for eleven sites across the globe, and by covering a longer period and a broader set of sites than previous studies, we provide the most detailed analysis to date of the duration and persistence of cropland abandonment.
Given that some abandonment periods are inherently limited by the length of our time series (and may remain abandoned beyond the three decades covered by our data), tracking recultivation rates for each year provides a more accurate understanding of persistence.
Our results reveal the temporal nature of cropland abandonment and its potential to sequester carbon and conserve biodiversity.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Abandonment duration}

Cropland abandonment was widespread across our eleven study sites.
We detected 8.36 million ha (Mha) of croplands that were abandoned at least once between 1987 and 2017 across our eleven sites.
(To exclude normal fallow periods, we only classify croplands as ``abandoned'' when they have not been cultivated for at least five contiguous years; see Materials and Methods.)
This corresponds to 35.22\% of the total cropland extent of 23.74 Mha (i.e., all lands that were cultivated at some point during the time series).
At individual sites, the area of cropland abandoned at least once ranged from 25.25\% (Wisconsin, USA) to 56.16\% (Vitebsk, Belarus/Smolensk, Russia) of the total cropland extent (Figures \ref{fig:area-abn-panel} and \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}), except for Mato Grosso, Brazil, where only 0.98\% was abandoned at least once (see Section S1.A.).

However, we also found that many of these abandoned croplands were recultivated: 37.77\% of abandoned area had been recultivated as of 2017, on average across sites (SD = 8.9\%; Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}).
In fact, only 5.73 Mha of croplands remained abandoned as of 2017 across our sites (Figure \ref{fig:maps-abn-duration}).
This corresponded to 24.15\% of the total cropland extent overall, ranging from 17.86\% (Nebraska, USA) to 41.06\% (Bosnia \& Herzegovina) at individual sites.
Accordingly, the mean duration of abandonment across all sites was short: 14.42 years (SD = 1.52), ranging from 12.86 years (Orenburg, Russia/Uralsk, Kazakhstan) to 17.7 years (Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Figure \ref{fig:mean-abn-duration}).
Abandonment duration also varied substantially within sites, with individual site standard deviations ranging between 6.95 (Orenburg/Uralsk) and 9.21 years (Mato Grosso) (for an average of 7.78 years across all sites).

\subsection*{Modeling abandonment decay \& recultivation}\label{modeling-abandonment-decay-recultivation}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Modeling abandonment decay \& recultivation}

We developed models to predict how long a given pixel of abandoned cropland will remain abandoned before it is recultivated, regardless of when it was abandoned during the time series.
These models also allow us to calculate the mean recultivation (or ``decay'') trajectory at each site (Figure \ref{fig:decay-curves-by-site}).
To do so, we defined a cohort of abandoned cropland as all cropland abandoned in a given year at a given site.
We modeled the proportion of each cohort remaining abandoned as a function of time since initial abandonment (see Figure \ref{fig:abn-decay-s}, Materials and Methods).

Recultivation occurred quickly: we predict that \textgreater50\% of abandoned croplands will be recultivated within 25 years of initial abandonment at almost all sites (Figure \ref{fig:abn-decay-s}).
At individual sites, the half-life (defined as the time required for half of the croplands abandoned in a given year to be recultivated) ranged from 12 years (Orenburg/Uralsk) to 24 years (Wisconsin).
Shaanxi/Shanxi (China) was a notable exception; here our models predicted a half-life of 48 years, and 137 years for complete turnover (defined as the time required for all abandonment in a given cohort to be recultivated; Figure \ref{fig:decay-curves-by-site}).
For comparison, complete turnover took 21 and 61 years respectively in Orenburg/Uralsk and Wisconsin.
The mean decay trajectories also display wide variation in the percentage of abandoned croplands that persist beyond 20 years: as little as 7.46\% in Orenburg/Uralsk, while up to 70.9\% in Shaanxi/Shanxi.

By modeling recultivation for each abandonment cohort, we investigated whether recultivation of abandoned cropland accelerated.
Most sites showed a negative trend in the time until recultivation, indicating that abandoned croplands were being recultivated more quickly in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:decay-rate-of-change}).
Based on a linear regression on the half-life (the time required for 50\% recultivation), over half of our sites had rates of change that were significantly different from zero and negative, corresponding to recultivation accelerating through time: Bosnia \& Herzegovina, Volgograd (Russia), Wisconsin, Nebraska, Orenburg/Uralsk, and Iraq (Figure \ref{fig:decay-rate-of-change}).
The remaining sites had trends that were not significantly different from zero.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Projecting future abandonment and recultivation}

Assuming that abandonment rates and recultivation rates remain constant at each site, our projection suggests that the impermanence of abandonment we observe is not an artifact of our time series being only 30 years long.
We project the mean duration of abandonment to plateau at 20 years or less at most sites (Figure \ref{fig:extrapolation-combo}), with the notable exception of Shaanxi/Shanxi, which is projected to plateau at a mean duration of 46 years.
The time required to plateau depends on the time required for complete turnover, ranging from 21 to 61 years for all sites except Mato Grosso (110 years) and Shaanxi/Shanxi (137 years).

Furthermore, we project that only a relatively small proportion of abandoned croplands will persist beyond 30 years (\textless27\% at most sites; Figure \ref{fig:extrapolation-area-by-age}).
Even in Shaanxi/Shanxi, the site we project will have the most long-lasting abandonment, only 40\% of abandoned land will remain so for longer than 50 years.

\section*{Discussion}\label{discussion}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Discussion}

Using a new detailed, annual land-cover time series, we found substantial amounts of cropland abandonment from 1987 to 2017 in eleven sites on four continents: 35.22\% of all lands that were cultivated during our time series were abandoned at least once between 1987 and 2017.
However, we also found substantial levels of recultivation, so that only 24.15\% of total cropland remained in an abandoned state as of 2017.
On average abandonment lasted only 15 years, and 37\% of abandoned croplands had been recultivated by 2017.
Furthermore, some sites had accelerating rates of recultivation, and even the sites with the most persistent abandonment are unlikely to remain uncultivated for \(\geq50\) years.
Our modeled decay rates portray a dynamic process, where abandonment is rarely an endpoint but rather part of a cycle of turnover on decadal timescales (20).

By tracking cohorts of abandoned croplands based on the year of abandonment, we developed a much more detailed and nuanced picture of abandonment persistence than previous studies.
For example, while Shaanxi/Shanxi had one of the shortest mean abandonment durations (because most abandonment took place towards the end of the time series), current recultivation trajectories indicate more persistent abandonment than we can observe during the time series.
Our models revealed Shaanxi/Shanxi to have the longest half-life and complete turnover time, due to a decrease in recultivation rates over time.
In contrast, Bosnia \& Herzegovina, which had the longest mean abandonment duration, experienced accelerating recultivation in recent years, limiting future persistence.

Furthermore, estimates of abandonment based on short time series or two points in time (e.g., 83 Mha estimated in ref. 4) likely overestimate the amount of persistent abandonment, due to both a failure to exclude short-term fallow periods, and, as our analysis shows, high rates of recultivation.
When estimating abandonment at our sites based on cultivation in two points in time (1987 and 2017), we find 5 Mha of ``abandonment,'' a 12.74\% underestimate compared to the 5.73 Mha of abandonment as of 2017 identified using our full annual time series.
This corresponds to site-level estimates that ranged from 39.75\% less (Goiás, Brazil) to 83.29\% more (Mato Grosso) area abandoned than the area identified using the full time series.
Moreover, the two-year assessments identify different areas of abandonment from those derived from our full annual time series, with spatial agreement ranging from 28.08\% (Mato Grosso) to 66.3\% (Bosnia \& Herzegovina) (see Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table}, Section S1.D.).

The abandonment and impermanence that we found generally matches that observed in the few other comparable case studies (6).
To the best of our knowledge, the only other study that uses an annual time series to investigate agricultural abandonment (in a grassland region of northern Kazakhstan between 1991-2017; ref. 24), observed abandonment of about 40\% of cultivated areas, and the subsequent recultivation of about 20\% of that abandonment.
This recultivation rate was similar to our most persistent site (Shaanxi/Shanxi), but lower than both our average recultivation rate across sites (37.77\%), and in our sites closest to Kazakhstan: Orenburg/Uralsk and Volgograd, which had higher recultivation rates of 43.34\% and 45.52\% respectively (Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}).

Our projected half-lives of 12-24 years at most sites were similar to those found in Costa Rica (20 years, ref. 26), but slightly longer than in other parts of the Neotropics (6, 27, 28).
Secondary forests were recleared more quickly in the Brazilian Amazon (50\% within 5 to 8 years), where 80\% of secondary forests were \(\leq20\) years old (6, 27, 28).
Across the tropics, only 33\% of forests regenerating after recent deforestation were \(\geq10\) years (31).
However, these differences may be the result of 1) a time delay between abandonment and sufficient regrowth of secondary woody vegetation to be detected by satellites, 2) our exclusion of abandonment of less than five years, or 3) our models of recultivation for each cohort, which eliminate the influence of the time series length, and lengthen abandonment estimates.

\subsection*{Implications for biodiversity recovery and carbon sequestration}\label{implications-for-biodiversity-recovery-and-carbon-sequestration}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Implications for biodiversity recovery and carbon sequestration}

Our results show that most cropland abandonment is unlikely to be long-lasting, contrary to optimistic assumptions (4, 32).
The high recultivation rate we observed will dramatically limit the scope for abandoned croplands to play a major role in carbon sequestration or the recovery of biodiversity.

There is, of course, substantial variability in how quickly and how completely ecosystems recover following disturbances and abandonment (33--35).
Natural regeneration can be a viable restoration strategy under the right conditions, especially after low-intensity disturbances (e.g., selective logging) and when there are relatively undisturbed or mature ecosystems nearby to act as propagule sources.
Under such conditions, plant and animal dispersal can result in secondary growth that can approach the habitat and carbon values of undisturbed ecosystems (17, 34, 35).

However, even under optimal conditions, recovery requires time, typically multiple decades, in order to recover species richness to values approximating those in reference systems (7, 14--16, 36).
Species richness values for rarer, forest-adapted, and old-growth dependent species recover even more slowly.
Importantly, when recovery towards old-growth ecosystems is measured in terms of community composition, species similarity, and vegetation structure, it can take much longer than when measured simply by the recovery of total species richness or abundance (which can be dominated by widespread generalist species) (34--37).

In some cases species-rich tropical ecosystems can regenerate quickly, but never on a time scale as short as the abandonment durations we observe here.
Chronosequences show that lowland Neotropical forests recover quickly in terms of tree species richness (reaching 80\% of old-growth levels after 20 years, 90\% after 31 years), but much more slowly in terms of tree species composition (34\% of old-growth levels after 20 years, requiring 487 years to reach 90\%) (13).
The area around these sites retained relatively high forest cover (76\% on average), however, and recovery is likely to be slower in more deforested landscapes (13).

Recovery can be rapid for certain animal groups in specific cases (e.g., birds and dung beetles in the Colombian Andes; ref. 17), but typically takes a long time for most types of vertebrate species.
Across tropical forests, amphibian, bird, mammal, and reptile species richness largely recovers within 40 years, but species compositional similarity for these vertebrate groups takes much longer to recover (if at all), particularly for late-successional species, insectivorous birds, and forest specialists (14).
No vertebrate groups reach species compositional similarity to reference old-growth forests, even in the oldest secondary forests (30-65 years) (14).

Grassland ecosystems can sometimes recover more quickly following disturbances than forests (38), but not often (15, 16).
On average, secondary grasslands distributed around the world that are between 1-251 years old contain only 53-76\% of the plant species richness of never-cultivated (i.e., undisturbed) grasslands (16).
Even after full recovery of species richness (with minimum estimated recovery times of \textgreater100 years), compositional similarity of secondary grasslands to undisturbed grasslands remains low (43\%).
Similarly, Minnesota (USA) grasslands showed quick initial gains in biodiversity following abandonment, but both biodiversity and productivity increased slowly after the first year, reaching only 73\% of the diversity and 53\% of the productivity levels of the reference ecosystem after 91 years (15).
Eurasian grasslands, where widespread abandonment has occurred, had not fully recovered with respect to either plant species richness or community composition after 24 years of observation (39), nor with respect to bird species richness and diversity after 18 years of observation (40).

Abandoned croplands also only achieve a small fraction of their carbon storage potential if abandonment lasts only a couple of decades.
Despite relatively quick accumulation of carbon in aboveground biomass in forests over the first few decades of regeneration, it can take between 50-100 years for secondary forests to achieve similar levels of biomass as old-growth forests (19, 41).
For example, Neotropical aboveground forest biomass reaches 90\% of old-growth forest biomass after a median of 66 years, but \textless50\% biomass after 20 years.
Furthermore, carbon accumulation estimates vary by biome and by prior land use.
Based on estimates of potential aboveground carbon accumulation rates during the first 30 years of natural regeneration in different biomes (18), we predict that the abandoned cropland areas that we studied could accumulate 30-70 Mg C/ha in aboveground biomass total over 20 years, or 18\%-45\% of the 110-250 Mg C/ha total that could be accumulated in aboveground biomass over 100 years (18).

Grassland biomes, where much of the abandonment we observed occurred, can also harbor substantial amounts of carbon sequestered in soils (42).
However, grassland soil carbon may accumulate even more slowly than aboveground forest biomass, taking a century or longer to return to reference levels (43).
For example, while abandoned croplands across Russia accumulated a total of 13.2 Mg C/ha in the top 5 cm of soil during the first 20 years following abandonment, these fields still had significantly less carbon sequestered than reference grasslands after 24 years of observation, and were expected to take \textgreater60 years to recover to reference levels (44).

Moreover, beyond the issue of the duration of abandonment, the very fact that these lands were used for agriculture can impede full achievement of carbon or biodiversity goals.
The degradation and slow recovery of soils, a lack of nearby source populations, a lack of natural disturbance regimes, and climate change all pose obstacles to successful recovery of stored carbon or biodiversity (34, 45, 46).
While natural regeneration is typically cheaper and sometimes more successful than active restoration, more heavily altered systems typically require more active approaches such as invasive species control or translocation of plants and animals, along with longer recovery times (17, 36, 43, 47).
Grassland regeneration is particularly challenging, because many grasslands require natural disturbance regimes (e.g., grazing or fire), which may be absent following abandonment (16).
Without such disturbances, grassland biodiversity can be lost if low-intensity farmlands are abandoned, particularly in historically unforested ecosystems (2, 16, 48, 49).

\hypertarget{conclusions}{%
\section*{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Conclusions}

We found strong evidence that abandoned croplands did not remain uncultivated for long periods of time at eleven sites across the globe.
Without new policies and incentives to discourage recultivation, abandoned areas are unlikely to provide meaningful biodiversity and carbon benefits.
Our results reinforce growing calls for enhanced monitoring of regeneration after abandonment (50), and the development of a stronger policy framework for managing such lands (7).
In some cases, active management of abandoned sites will be needed to achieve biodiversity and carbon goals.

There are a range of socioeconomic and political barriers hindering habitat regeneration in abandoned croplands.
These include policies that obligate farmers to cultivate land, a lack of incentives to protect and foster regenerating habitats, and perhaps most importantly, negative cultural perceptions of ``abandonment'' and the ``messy'' landscapes that result (7).
Agricultural abandonment is a consequence of complex societal changes, and the emotional distress associated with the loss of certain types of landscapes and rural ways of life can be substantial (2, 10, 11, 20).
Behavioral research into farmer decisions to recultivate abandoned croplands highlights the importance of addressing factors such as corruption, political and institutional support for agriculture, and demographics, alongside biophysical and environmental conditions, when managing abandonment (51).

In order for abandoned croplands to provide environmental benefits through habitat regeneration or carbon sequestration, they must persist for longer periods than we observed.
This could be achieved by designating abandoned fields as protected areas, incorporating natural regeneration into payments for ecosystem service programs to allow landowners to benefit economically, or by taking steps to support sustainable long-term cultivation of some sites, thereby reducing turnover among fields that have previously been part of long-term fallowing cycles.
As a case in point, the relative durability of abandonment at Shaanxi/Shanxi may be due to large-scale ecosystem restoration programs that began in the late 1990s and created economic incentives to reforest croplands.
This is encouraging, even though there continues to be a need to improve the biodiversity outcomes of such programs (52).
We stress that any policies should be developed jointly with local communities to address trade-offs between biodiversity, carbon storage, and livelihoods.

Our results make one thing clear: if cropland abandonment continues to be as short-lived as we show here, the large potential benefits of regenerating habitats to both store carbon and sustain biodiversity will remain an untapped opportunity.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Abandonment maps}

We use annual land cover maps with 30-m resolution from 1987-2017 (25), derived from publicly available Landsat satellite imagery, mapping four land cover classes: 1) cropland, 2) herbaceous vegetation (e.g., grassland), 3) woody vegetation (e.g., forests), and 4) non-vegetation (e.g., water, urban, or barren land).
Our eleven sites were mapped with high accuracy (average overall accuracy \(85\pm4\)\%) and provide broad coverage of different continents and ecosystems (Figure \ref{fig:maps-abn-duration}).
We focused exclusively on cropland abandonment, because pasture abandonment is very difficult to discern from satellite imagery and is not captured in our data.
Yin et al. (25) selected sites where recent abandonment was documented and likely given socioeconomic, political, or environmental conditions.
Thus, while our results are likely representative of those areas that have recently experienced abandonment, they are not a representative sample for the globe, and overestimate the overall prevalence of abandonment.

\hypertarget{defining-abandonment}{%
\subsection*{Defining abandonment}\label{defining-abandonment}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Defining abandonment}

Differentiating abandonment from short-term fallowing or crop rotations is difficult because agricultural practices can vary widely by region, and studies use many different definitions (25).
Here, in order to exclude short-term fallowing, we define ``abandonment'' as cropland that is no longer under active cultivation, is left free of direct human influence (e.g., is not converted to urban land use), and remains so for at least five subsequent years, following FAO (53).
Recognizing that longer abandonment thresholds may be more appropriate in certain contexts, we performed a sensitivity analysis by varying our abandonment definition (Section S1.C.) and found that, as expected, longer definitions resulted in less abandonment over all, longer average abandonment durations (Figure \ref{fig:abn-thresholds-mean-duration}), and lower recultivation rates (Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}).
However, even when only considering abandonment \(\geq10\) years, we still observed between 11.61\% and 30.37\% recultivation across our sites (in Shaanxi/Shanxi and Volgograd respectively), suggesting the reliability of our abandonment definition.

\hypertarget{data-processing}{%
\subsection*{Data processing}\label{data-processing}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Data processing}

We processed and analyzed abandonment map data in RStudio version 1.4.1717 (54), using R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18), primarily with the \texttt{raster} (55), \texttt{data.table} (56), and \texttt{tidyverse} (57) packages.

We identified periods of cropland abandonment by tracking each pixel's land cover through time and looking for land-cover changes that indicated transitions between cultivation and abandonment.
We first implemented five- and eight-year moving window temporal filters to smooth land-cover trajectories and remove land-cover changes that are temporally unlikely (Section S2).
Together with our five-year abandonment threshold, these temporal filters address very short-term misclassifications that might otherwise appear like recultivation.

We classified a pixel as ``abandoned'' anytime it transitioned from cropland to either herbaceous or woody vegetation (collectively referred to as ``non-cropland'') and subsequently remained classified as non-cropland for five or more consecutive years.
We considered an abandoned pixel to be ``recultivated'' when it transitioned from abandoned to cropland.
Pixels that transitioned from cropland to the non-vegetation class were not considered ``abandoned,'' and were excluded from our analysis.
Non-vegetated land consisted of \textless10\% of total site area in all sites except Shaanxi (12.7\%) and Iraq (52.8\%), and remained stable or declined over time in all eleven sites.

\hypertarget{calculating-abandonment-duration}{%
\subsection*{Calculating abandonment duration}\label{calculating-abandonment-duration}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Calculating abandonment duration}

We calculated abandonment duration as the number of years that elapsed between the initial transition from cropland to non-cropland, and either recultivation or the end of the time series.
Because our abandonment definition only considers croplands that have been abandoned for five or more contiguous years, the minimum abandonment duration is five years.
Because a pixel may be abandoned and recultivated multiple times throughout the time series, we calculated the mean abandonment duration in two ways: 1) across all periods of abandonment (Figure \ref{fig:mean-abn-duration}), and 2) across only the longest period of abandonment experienced by each pixel (Figures \ref{fig:mean-abn-duration-w-max} and \ref{fig:maps-max-abn-duration}).

\end{figure}

Because some abandonment periods are limited by the length of the time series, we modeled recultivation of abandoned croplands as a function of time since initial abandonment.
We tracked recultivation (``decay'') by calculating the proportion of each cohort of pixels abandoned in a given year that remain abandoned in each year following abandonment.
We parameterized linear models predicting the proportion of abandoned cropland in each cohort remaining abandoned as a function of time since initial abandonment.
We tested a range of model specifications, including linear and log transformations of both proportion and time, and multiple time predictor terms.
Importantly, we included cohort level fixed effects, fitting unique coefficients for each cohort at each site.

We selected the highest performing model based on Akaike Information Criterion values (AIC; Figure \ref{fig:AIC}).
For cohorts of abandonment initially abandoned in years \(y = 1988, ... , 2013\), our model predicted the proportion \(p\) of each cohort \(y\) remaining abandoned as a function of time \(t\) (i.e., the number of years following initial abandonment), with one log-transformed and one linear term of time (Equation \eqref{eq:mod-spec}).

\begin{equation}
p_{y} = 1 + \beta_{1,y} log(t + 1) + \beta_{2,y} t \label{eq:mod-spec}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,y}\) and \(\beta_{2,y}\) represent the regression coefficients on the log and linear terms of time \(t\), respectively, for cohort \(y\).
Model assumptions were tested through visual inspection of diagnostic plots (Figures \ref{fig:diag-resid-fitted} and \ref{fig:diag-qq}, full details in Section S2.C.).
We calculated each site's mean recultivation trend by taking the mean of the model coefficients across all cohorts (Figure \ref{fig:mean-abn-duration}).
Modeled decay trajectories are shown for one example site, Shaanxi/Shanxi (China), in Figure \ref{fig:abn-decay-s}, and model coefficients for all sites in Figure \ref{fig:decay-mod-coef}.

To estimate changes in persistence over time, we calculated the time required for half of a given cohort to be recultivated based on the modeled recultivation trajectory of each cohort.
We parameterized a linear model on this value for each cohort to identify temporal changes in recultivation patterns at each site (Section S2.D.).
Trends were considered statistically significant when the 95\% confidence interval for model coefficients did not include zero (Figure \ref{fig:decay-rate-of-change}).

\subsection*{Projecting future abandonment and recultivation}\label{projecting-future-abandonment-and-recultivation-1}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Projecting future abandonment and recultivation}

Based on our modeled decay rates, we project abandonment and recultivation in the future based on two assumptions: (1) a constant amount of cropland is newly abandoned each year, based on the mean area of cropland abandoned each year at each site (Figure \ref{fig:turnover-grid}); and (2) all abandoned croplands are recultivated at the mean predicted rate for each site (Figure \ref{fig:decay-curves-by-site}).
Total abandonment in our projection remained below the total cropland extent at each site.
We also considered an alternative assumption in which annual abandonment linearly declined to 0 between 2017 and 2050, but found similarly short mean abandonment durations (below 37 years at all sites by 2050; see Figures \ref{fig:extrapolation2-combo} and \ref{fig:extrapolation2-area-by-age}).
While mean age of abandoned land increased through time after 2017 (and most dramatically after 2050), it remained below 37 years at all sites by 2050.
Increases in mean abandonment duration were offset by recultivation, and total area abandoned declined quickly after 2020 at most sites.
See details in Section S2.E.

\section{Extended Results}\label{results-si}}

Cropland abandonment at individual sites (excluding Mato Grosso, see Section S1.A.) ranged between 314,374.8 ha (Shaanxi) and 930,424 ha (Orenburg) as of 2017 (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}), and because our sites varied in size, this corresponded to between 7.91\% (Nebraska) and 19.91\% (Shaanxi) of the total area of each site (Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-panel}).

On average, we found that cropland abandonment lasted for only 14.42 years (SD = 1.52 years) across our time series at our eleven sites.
Note, however, that these summary statistics are calculated based on the mean abandonment duration at each site, to account for different site sizes.
The summary statistics reported are therefore the mean of the mean abandonment duration at each of our eleven sites, and the standard deviation of the mean abandonment duration at each of our eleven sites.

We also calculated the mean standard deviation of abandonment duration across our sites, which was 7.78 years.
The former is a measure of the spread of mean abandonment lengths across the 11 sites, whereas the latter is a measure of the average spread of abandonment lengths at each site.
See Table \ref{tab:summary-stats-table}.

The area abandoned at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-panel} (see also Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table}).
The area abandoned at each site, by age class, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}, and the area in each land cover class at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:area-by-lc}.
Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class} shows that the timing of abandonment varied across sites; some sites showed more abandonment earlier in the time series (e.g., Iraq; Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Volgograd, Russia; Nebraska/Wyoming, USA; \& Mato Grosso, Brazil), some showed consistent abandonment over time (e.g., Vitebsk, Belarus/Smolensk, Russia; Goiás, Brazil; and Wisconsin, USA), and others showed increasing abandonment later on in the time series (e.g., sites in Shaanxi/Shanxi and Chongqing, China).
Furthermore, Figure \ref{fig:turnover-grid} shows the annual gain, loss, and net change in the area of abandoned croplands abandoned at each site.

\hypertarget{mato-grosso}{%
\subsection{Limited abandonment in Mato Grosso}\label{mato-grosso}}

Mato Grosso, Brazil, was the only site that did not experience significant amounts of cropland abandonment during our time series.
This is unsurprising given the recent history of agriculturally-driven land-use change over the last few decades.
That being said, the abandonment that did take place in Mato Grosso was relatively more durable, requiring 25 years to decline by half and 110 years for complete turnover.
However, because Mato Grosso showed large amounts of new cultivation over the source of our time series and relatively little abandonment (9,006 ha, or 0.47\% of the total cropland extent, as of 2017), these results should be interpreted with care.

\hypertarget{biomes}{%
\subsection{Biomes}\label{biomes}}

Some ecosystems and biomes seem to recover more quickly than others, namely in relatively higher latitudes, relatively colder climates, and in relatively more humid biomes (58).
Our sites cover a range of biomes (Figure \ref{fig:site-biomes}), including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Temperate Broadleaf and Mixed Forests (Vitebsk Belarus/Smolensk, Russia; Bosnia \& Herzegovina; Wisconsin, USA),
\item
  Temperate Grasslands, Savannas, and Shrublands (Nebraska/Wyoming, USA; Orenburg, Russia/Uralsk, Kazakhstan; Volgograd, Russia),
\item
  Tropical Grassland (Goiás and Mato Grosso, Brazil),
\item
  Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests (Chongqing, China; Mato Grosso, Brazil),
\item
  Montane Grassland and Shrublands (Shaanxi/Shanxi, China), and
\item
  Deserts \& Xeric Shrublands (Iraq).
\end{itemize}

The long-term land-cover outcomes for abandoned croplands are shown (as of 2017) in Figure \ref{fig:abn-prop-lc}.
Land cover outcomes for abandoned croplands showed wide variation across sites, with most abandonment in Wisconsin being classified as forest by 2017 (60\% forest, 40\% grassland), but remaining mostly in grassland elsewhere (Figure \ref{fig:abn-prop-lc}).
This limited woody vegetation regrowth may be a product of the biome, but it may simply be a result of insufficient time for woody biomass to develop.
Land cover alone cannot confidently serve as a proxy for ecosystem recovery.

\hypertarget{abn-thresholds}{%
\subsection{The effect of varying abandonment definitions}\label{abn-thresholds}}

A relatively short-term definition of abandonment might result in an overestimation of recultivation, because short-term abandonment may be better understood as cyclical fallow periods, not true abandonment (20).
Because typical fallow period length may vary around the world, we tested multiple abandonment thresholds in order to test the sensitivity of our results to our choice of a five-year abandonment definition, following the FAO (53).
As our abandonment threshold increased in length, the mean abandonment duration across our sites increased accordingly, ranging between 7 years (no threshold) and 19 years (10-year threshold).
As expected, using a longer abandonment definition reduced the amount of cropland abandonment we detected, which is also shown in the area in the different colored age classes in Figure \ref{fig:area-abn-by-age-class}.

The proportion of abandoned croplands that were recultivated by the end of the time series also responded to our abandonment threshold, with less recultivation for longer abandonment thresholds (Figure \ref{fig:recult-by-threshold}).
However, even at the longest abandonment definition (10 years), we still saw that between 10\% and 30\% of abandoned croplands were recultivated by the end of the time series.
We find that the mean area of abandoned croplands that get recultivated by the end of the time series declines from 37.77\% with a 5 year threshold to 30.93\% with a 7 year threshold, and 22.83\% with a 10 year threshold.
This indicates that the abandonment and recultivation we observe is not merely a function of our five-year abandonment definition.

\hypertarget{twoyr-vs-annual}{%
\subsection{Comparing annual and two-year estimates of abandonment}\label{twoyr-vs-annual}}

Some studies estimate cropland abandonment by simply looking for areas where land cover is classified as ``cultivated'' in one year, but not in a later year (e.g., 1992 and 2015 in ref. 4).
In order to understand the magnitude of the differences that could result from using this two-year approach, we estimated cropland abandonment by simply identifying areas that were classified as ``cropland'' in 1987 and classified as either ``woody vegetation'' or ``herbaceous vegetation'' in 2017 (i.e., excluding ``non-vegetation'').

Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table} shows the area of abandoned croplands as identified using a five-year abandonment definition and the full annual time series (Column 2), and the area of abandoned croplands identified using only the difference between 2017 and 1987 (Column 3).
These two methods produced abandonment area estimates that ranged between 39.75\% lower (Goiás, Brazil) and 83.29\% higher (Mato Grosso, Brazil) than the abandoned area identified using the full time series.

Not only do these methods produce different area estimates, but they also differ in the location of the abandonment they identify, with spatial agreement of only 28.08\% (Mato Grosso, Brazil) to 66.3\% (Bosnia \& Herzegovina) (see Table \ref{tab:twoyr-diff-table}).
We measure spatial agreement using the Jaccard similarity index {[}Legendre2012{]}, a measure of overlap between two sets, defined as the proportion of shared elements, or the intersection divided by the union (Equation \eqref{eq:jaccard-equation}) (59):

\begin{equation}
J(a,b) = \frac{a\cap b}{a\cup b} \label{eq:jaccard-equation}
\end{equation}

\hypertarget{maps-of-abandonment-duration-as-of-2017-and-maximum-duration-during-time-series}{%
\subsection{Maps of abandonment duration as of 2017 and maximum duration during time series}\label{maps-of-abandonment-duration-as-of-2017-and-maximum-duration-during-time-series}}

As described in the main text, because a pixel may be abandoned and recultivated multiple times throughout the time series, we calculated the mean abandonment duration in two ways: 1) across all periods of abandonment (as shown in Figure 2), and 2) across only the longest period of abandonment experienced by each pixel.
Maps of the maximum abandonment duration at each pixel at each site is shown in Figure \ref{fig:maps-max-abn-duration} (serving as a companion to Figure 1).
The distribution of maximum duration values, and the corresponding mean maximum duration value at each site, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mean-abn-duration-w-max} (serving as a companion to Figure 2).

Expanded site-specific results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:panel-b}-\ref{fig:panel-w}.

\hypertarget{methods-si}{%
\section{Extended Methods}\label{methods-si}}

As noted in our main text, we build on annual land cover maps for 1987-2017 developed by Yin et al. (25).
The following section outlines our data processing and analytical methods in more specific detail than was possible in the main text.
We processed and analyzed our abandonment map data in RStudio version 1.4.1717 (54), using R version 4.1.0 (2021-05-18), relying heavily on the \texttt{\{raster\}} (55), \texttt{\{terra\}} (60), \texttt{\{data.table\}} (56), and \texttt{\{tidyverse\}} (57) packages.

\hypertarget{classifying-abandonment}{%
\subsection{Classifying abandonment}\label{classifying-abandonment}}

Pixels that remained in cropland or non-cropland classes throughout the entire time series were excluded, as were periods of non-cropland that began in the first year of the time series, even if that pixel was later classified as cropland and subsequently abandoned.
In effect, we only counted periods of abandonment that we could verify had followed agricultural activity during our time series.

As noted, pixels that transitioned from cropland to the non-vegetation land cover class were not considered ``abandoned,'' and therefore we excluded all non-vegetation pixels from our entire analysis.
These pixels accounted for \textless10\% of total site area at all sites except Shaanxi (12.7\%) and Iraq (52.8\%), and remained stable or declined over time at all eleven sites (see Figure \ref{fig:area-by-lc}).

All area calculations were performed using the \texttt{\{terra\}} package's \texttt{cellSize()} function, which calculates the spherical area of each cell as defined by its four corners (60).

\hypertarget{temporal-filters}{%
\subsection{Temporal filters}\label{temporal-filters}}

In order to address potential classification errors in a single year, we implemented a series of temporal filters designed to smooth trajectories by looking for short-term land-cover changes that are temporally unlikely.
We applied five-year and eight-year moving-window filters that searched for short periods of land cover classifications that do not match those immediately before and after, and subsequently updated them to match the surrounding classifications.
Specifically, the five-year filter searched for one year periods that did not match the two years immediately before and after (i.e., patterns of \texttt{11011}, where \texttt{1} represents non-cropland and \texttt{0} represents cropland), and our eight-year filter searched for two year periods that did not match the three years before and after (i.e., \texttt{11100111}).
The central classifications were then updated to match the classes on either end.

\hypertarget{decay-models-si}{%
\subsection{Modeling abandonment decay}\label{decay-models-si}}

Our mean abandonment duration metric tells us about the general persistence of abandoned croplands throughout the time series.
However, this value is limited by the time series length, and does not account for when the majority of the abandonment took place at a site, nor whether a period of abandonment ends as a results of recultivation or the end of the time series.
As a result, the mean abandonment duration does not tell us how long to expect a piece of land to remain abandoned, nor how abandonment length varies through time.
To address this constraint, we track the trajectory of each pixel through time following its initial abandonment, grouping pixels abandoned in a given year into ``cohorts.'' Decay rates provide information about how long it takes for land to be recultivated, complementing the mean abandonment length and providing a more nuanced story about how long to expect abandonment to last.

For example, a site may have a relatively short mean length of abandonment (e.g., Shaanxi/Shanxi {[}China{]}, with a mean abandonment length of 13 years; see Figure 1), but also have a gradual decay rate, indicating that land should stay abandoned for a relatively longer amount of time.
This may result from more abandonment occurring towards the end of the time series; this land simply does not have as long to age and shows up as younger in our data, regardless of how long it may last.
Looking at abandonment decay rates for each cohort individually allows us to produce a decay rate for each site in general in a way that accounts for when during the time series a piece of land was abandoned (i.e., giving us a sense of how long to expect a given piece of land to remain abandoned, even into the future).

\hypertarget{model-selection-and-diagnostics}{%
\subsubsection{Model selection and diagnostics}\label{model-selection-and-diagnostics}}

We fit linear models using the \texttt{lm()} function in R's core statistics package \texttt{\{stats\}}, predicting the proportion of abandoned cropland in each cohort remaining abandoned as a function of time since initial abandonment at each site.
The proportion of abandoned cropland remaining abandoned is measured relative to the area abandoned 5 years following the year of initial abandonment, as dictated by our five year abandonment definition.

We tested a range of model specifications, including linear and log transformations of both \emph{proportion} and \emph{time}.
Due to a linear relationship between model residuals and time when including only one term for \emph{time}, we also tested models containing multiple \emph{time} predictor terms, including both log and linear terms.

We chose a model with the following specifications shown in Equation 1 and reproduced here in Equation \eqref{eq:mod-spec-SI}.
For cohorts of abandonment initially abandoned in years \(y = 1988, ... , 2013\), we estimate the proportion \(p\) of each cohort \(y\) remaining abandoned as a function of time \(t\) (i.e., based on the number of years after initial abandonment).

\begin{equation}
p_{y} = 1 + \beta_{1,y} log(t + 1) + \beta_{2,y} t \label{eq:mod-spec-SI}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,y}\) represents the regression coefficient on the log term of time \(t\) for cohort \(y\), and \(\beta_{2,y}\) represents the regression coefficient on the linear term of time \(t\) for cohort \(y\).
We allow for \emph{cohort} level fixed effects, fitting unique coefficients for each cohort at each site.
We ran individual models for each site, using a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ I(proportion\ -\ 1)\ \ \textasciitilde{}\ 0\ +\ log(time\ +\ 1):cohort\ +\ I(time):cohort)} on data for only that site.
Taken together, these 11 models are correspond to a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ I(proportion\ -\ 1)\ \ \textasciitilde{}\ 0\ +\ log(time\ +\ 1):cohort:site\ +\ I(time):cohort:site)}.

Model selection was performed based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values (Figure \ref{fig:AIC}), selecting the model with the lowest (i.e., more negative) AIC value.
We confirmed that linear model assumptions were not violated through visual inspection of both residuals vs.~fitted plots (Figure \ref{fig:diag-resid-fitted}) and Q-Q plots (Figure \ref{fig:diag-qq}).

\hypertarget{recultivation-decay-model-results}{%
\subsubsection{Recultivation (``decay'') model results}\label{recultivation-decay-model-results}}

The observed data, fitted values from these linear models, and mean decay rates for each site, are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-model-grid}.

In order to calculate the mean decay trajectory at each site (as shown in Figure 3), we took the mean of the log coefficients (\(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\)) and the linear coefficients (\(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\)) respectively across all cohorts \(y\) at each site.
These mean values are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-mod-coef}.
We then used these mean coefficient values (\(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\) and \(\beta_{1, \bar{y}}\)) to define a new function describing the mean recultivation (or decay) trajectory at each site, using the same for as Equation \eqref{eq:mod-spec-SI}.

An alternative representation of the mean recultivation rate is shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-time-to-range}.

\hypertarget{section-methods-rate-of-change}{%
\subsection{Change in recultivation rates over time}\label{section-methods-rate-of-change}}

We examined the rate of change of recultivation rates by calculating the half-life, \(t_{half,s}\), defined as the time required for half (50\%) of a given cohort of abandoned cropland to be recultivated, and parameterizing a simple linear model on these half-life values as a function of time, using the \texttt{stats::lm()} function in R's core statistics package \texttt{\{stats\}}.
We estimate the half-life, \(t_{half,s}\), as a function of the year of initial abandonment (\(yearabn_{s}\)), at each site \(s\), as shown in Equation \eqref{eq:rate-of-change-lm}.

\begin{equation}
t_{half,s} = \beta_{0,s} + \beta_{1,s} yearabn_{s} \label{eq:rate-of-change-lm}
\end{equation}

Where \(\beta_{1,s}\) represents the regression slope on the year abandoned (cohort) for site \(s\) (\(yearabn_{s}\)), and \(\beta_{0,s}\) represents the intercept.
This corresponds to a \texttt{stats::lm()} call of \texttt{lm(formula\ =\ t\_half\ \textasciitilde{}\ year\_abandoned)}, run for each site individually.
Results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:decay-rate-of-change}.

We confirmed that model assumptions were met through visual inspection of residuals vs.~fitted plots (Figure \ref{fig:rate-of-change-diag-resid-fitted}) and Q-Q plots (Figure \ref{fig:rate-of-change-diag-qq}).

\hypertarget{section-extrapolation-si}{%
\subsection{Projecting abandonment duration into the future}\label{section-extrapolation-si}}

The results of the projection highlighted in the main text (referred to here as ``Extrapolation 1'') are shown in Figure \ref{fig:extrapolation-combo} and Figure \ref{fig:extrapolation-area-by-age}.
As noted in the main text, we make two simple assumptions in our projection of abandonment and recultivation into the future: specifically, that 1) recultivation rates remain the same (based on mean recultivation trends at each site, shown in Figure 3, and that 2) a constant amount of cropland is newly abandoned each year, based on the mean annual gain in abandonment shown in Figure \ref{fig:annual-gain-trend}b (note: the annual gain in abandonment in Figure \ref{fig:annual-gain-trend}a corresponds to the dark green bars in Figure \ref{fig:turnover-grid}).

Given that abandonment may not continue indefinitely, we also explore an alternative to our second assumption about the amount of additional abandonment each year.
In this alternative assumption (``Extrapolation 2''), the area abandoned each year is the same as ``Extrapolation 1'' from 1987-2017, based on the mean annual gain in abandonment (Figure \ref{fig:annual-gain-trend}b), but linearly declines between 2017-2050, reaching 0 ha at each site in 2050 (see Figures \ref{fig:extrapolation2-combo} and \ref{fig:extrapolation2-area-by-age}).

While mean age of abandoned land increased through time after 2017 (and most dramatically after 2050), it remained below 37 years at all sites by 2050.
Increases in mean abandonment duration were offset by recultivation, and total area abandoned declined quickly after 2020 at most sites.
The mean abandonment duration increases as annual abandonment declines, as the total pool of abandoned land grows older and is gradually recultivated.
