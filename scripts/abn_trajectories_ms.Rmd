# Introduction

Populations are in flux around the world, as people seek new economic opportunities in cities and flee changing environments and conflicts.
Coupled with environmental changes and other factors that render some agricultural lands economically inviable, this rural outmigration has contributed to a growing global trend of agricultural abandonment.
In a world with increasing competition for land, abandoned agricultural lands are highly sought after for diverse goals such as increased cultivation, biofuel production, and carbon-sequestration; to conservation scientists, this land represents a potentially large source of new habitat for wildlife as vegetation regenerates.

However, understanding agricultural abandonment and its potential impacts on biodiversity requires not only detailed information on where and how abandonment is taking place, but critically, what happens to abandoned lands after they are abandoned.
Most estimates of abandonment are either inferred from aggregated estimates of regional cultivation (e.g. from FAO data on cultivated area; [@Isbell2019; @Munroe2013]), or from estimates of the gross area abandoned in a given year [@Lark2015].
Both approaches lack spatial and temporal detail on the trajectories taken by individual pieces of land, which is critical for understanding the environmental implications of abandonment [@Yin2020].

Recent advances in satellite imagery-based mapping have made it possible to produce maps of agricultural abandonment with both high spatial resolution and temporal resolution, allowing us to ask questions about the timing and trajectories of agricultural abandonment.
Here, we utilize a new time-series of agricultural abandonment derived from publicly available Landsat imagery (1987-2017, 31 years) to investigate how long abandonment lasts, how abandoned lands "decay," and which factors seem to determine the length of abandonment and recultivation. 
Specifically, we ask the following questions:

1. How long is abandoned land typically abandoned for, and how does this differ across sites?
2. What do abandonment decay rates (recultivation rates) look like at each site, and how do these differ between sites and through time?
3. Finally, what factors are most important for determining which pieces of land remain abandoned for longer periods of time, and which lands are recultivated?

We use case studies of Brazil (2), the US (2), Southern & Eastern Europe (4), the Middle East (1), and China (2) to provide a better understanding of how these patterns vary across regions [@Yin2020] (see Figure \@ref(fig:site-locations)).

@Yin2020 established several methodological advances, including improvement in the mapping of 1) the timing of initial abandonment (year first abandoned), and 2) the abandonment rate (amount of abandoned land in a given year divided by the amount of agricultural land in either a) the previous year or b) the beginning of the time series). However, Yin et al. did not assess the persistence of abandonement (how long abandoned lands stay abandoned for), frequency and patterns of recultivation, the patterns of fragmentation in the resulting landscape, nor the implications of these for biodiversity. (These last two are likely for a second paper.)

Previous studies of Costa Rica [@Reid2018] and the Amazon [@Nunes2020] have focused on the persistence and timing of secondary forest growth and age (as identified by the presence of woody vegetation regrowth), but not exclusively on abandoned agricultural lands.
Identifying forest regeneration by picking up the signal of woody regrowth in satellite imagery may miss abandonment at earlier stages or that is regenerating into non-forest habitats [@Yin2020].
Focusing on abandonment itself, not only to detecting woody revegetation, provides a better understanding of the outcomes of abandonment, and provides critical context for understanding the potential that abandonment holds for habitat regeneration, carbon sequestration, and other land uses.

Many studies of regeneration also do not consider patterns of persistence, or age of abandonment or regeneration [@Yin2020].
@Crouzeilles2020 only consider pixels as regenerated if they were in forest in 2016 and had been forest for at least 3 years, without assessing average persistence.
@Aide2019 assess changes in woody vegetation over a 14 year period, but do so by averaging across years, losing the temporal pattern or regeneration and recultivation.
@Yin2020 define land as abandoned when it has been continuously uncultivated for 5 years, but do not assess the length of time abandoned in detail.

These simple insights about the trajectories taken by abandoned agricultural land will provide much needed context to broad statements about recent and future abandonment and the contribution that abandonment many make to habitat regeneration and biodiversity conservation [@Chazdon2020].
The bulk of abandoned land may be relatively short-lived, from the perspective of ecological succession or carbon sequestration, and unlikely to regenerate into valuable habitat on its own without active policies to protect this land and encourage regeneration.

## Research questions

Our primary goal is to understand the temporal nature of agricultural abandonment by exploring the trajectories taken by each piece of abandoned land through time.
Our main point is simple: abandoned land is not a permanent phenomenon.
In fact, the period of abandonment varies quite a bit around the world and through time.
As a result, in order to assess the effect of abandonment on biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and food security, we need a better understanding of how long abandonment lasts, how abandoned lands "decay," and which factors seem to determine the timing and decay. 
A better understanding of the timing and persistence of abandonment at various sites around the world is crucial to understanding the conservation implications of agricultural abandonment and informing policies designed to manage abandoned lands.

In pursuit of this understanding, we address three specific questions:

1. How long is land actually abandoned for, on average, and how does abandonment length vary through space (i.e. at different sites)?
2. How quickly is land recultivated, as measured through "abandonment decay rates"?
    a. How do these decay rates vary through time and space? (What proportion of abandoned land remains abandoned long-term [e.g. >20 years])
3. What factors best predict abandonment trajectories?
    a. What predicts which pieces of land are abandoned for the longest periods of time? In other words, are some areas more likely to experience more durable abandonment?
    b. What predicts recultivation? Are less suitable lands recultivated more quickly? Are more recently abandoned lands more frequently recultivated? In other words, does the probability that a piece of abandoned land will be recultivated depend on how long it has been abandoned for?

## Definitions of abandonment

One of our main points relates to how we define "abandonment," specifically, showing that abandonment is in many places around the world, not a permanent phenomenon.
Differentiating "true" abandonment from less permanent land-use changes, such as short-term fallowing or crop rotations, is a challenge, in no small part because definitions can vary so widely - by region and by study.
In fact, abandonment is better viewed as a land-use transition in which land may pass through a spectrum of stages [@Munroe2013].
Here, when we refer to "abandonment," we aim to capture agricultural land that is no longer being actively cultivated. 
We do not refer to changes from intensive cropped to less intensive uses, such as extensive grazing.
In order to exclude short-term fallow periods, we define land as abandoned when it has remained uncultivated for five consecutive years [following FAO]. We assess the influence of this threshold in the SI.
We focus exclusively on cropland abandonment, not the abandonment of pasturelands, which is more difficult to discern from satellite imagery (though recent advances have been made; cite) and is not incorporated into our current dataset.

```

## Filtering

We applied a temporal filter to remove periods of recultivation of only 1 year in between years of abandonment. This had the effect of only considering recultivation periods of 2 or more years.

## Tracking abandonment trajectories

## Modeling abandonment decay

### Motivation: how does the average length of time abandoned differ from the decay rate? What does the "time to half" actually tell us? What is the importance of looking at decay rates?

The mean length of time abandoned (in years) is based on all periods of abandonment in the time series, because a given pixel can experience multiple periods of abandonment throughout the time series.
This value tells us about the general persistence of abandoned land at a given site, over the course of the full time series. 
However, this value is limited by when the majority of the abandonment took place at a site, because we have now way of knowing how long abandonment that takes place towards the end of the time series will last for. Will it last for two additional years beyond the end of the time series, or 20?
As a result, the mean abandonment length does not tell us how long to expect a piece of land to remain abandoned, and does not tell us about how abandonment length varies through time. (Note: assessing temporal changes in mean length abandoned would involve looking at the mean length of time abandoned at each year of Figure \@ref(fig:abn-age-class).)
Restricting the mean length to only those pixels that are both abandoned and recultivated within the time series excludes a large portion of our data, and may underestimate the eventual lengths of many periods of abandonment that begin close to the end of our time series.

To address this challenge, we look at groups of pixels that are abandoned in a given year (which we call "cohorts" of abandonment) and track their trajectories through time.
For each cohort of abandoned land, we track recultivation, or "abandonment decay," by assessing the proportion of each cohort that remains abandoned through time, relative to when that land was first abandoned (the cohort year).
Decay rates show us information about how long it takes for land to be recultivated. 
This information complements the mean abandonment length, telling a slightly different story. 
For example, a site may have a relatively short mean length of abandonment (e.g. Shaanxi/Shanxi Province, with a mean abandonment length of 13 years; see Figure \@ref(fig:site-locations)), but also have a gradual decay rate, indicating that land should stay abandoned for a relatively longer amount of time. 
This may result from more abandonment occurring towards the end of the time series; this land simply does not have as long to age and shows up as younger in our data, regardless of how long it may last.

Looking at abandonment decay rates for each cohort individually allows us to produce a decay rate for each site in general in a way that accounts for when during the time series a piece of land was abandoned (i.e. giving us a sense of how long to expect a given piece of land to remain abandoned, even into the future). 
(Note: the following three sentences may be redundant.)
For example, imagine two fields, one abandoned in 1990 and the other abandoned in 2010. 
They may both end up remaining abandoned for 15 years, but the second field will show up as having an age of 7 at the end of our time series (which ends in 2017), regardless of how long it lasts. 
One way we could deal with this is to only look at land that was affirmatively recultivated; another is to look at decay rates for each cohort, over time. 

Importantly, this approach also allows us to look at changes in persistence over time.
We are able to see if the rate at which abandonment land decays (i.e. is recultivated) gets faster, stays the same, or slows down over time.

Translating decay rates into an intuitive metric is difficult. Many studies of exponential decay reference the "half-life," or the time it takes for a quantity to reduce by half. Because we model abandonment decay flexibly, so that the rate at which a given cohort of land is recultivated can speed up or slow down through time, this concept of half-life does not work in our context. Rather, we measure the length of time it takes for a given cohort to decay to a specific proportion: the time it takes for a cohort to fall to a proportion of 50%.

### Decay models

To investigate the decay of abandoned land, we ran linear models using the `stats::lm()` function in R's core statistics package, predicting the proportion of the initial amount of abandoned land remaining abandoned  as a function of time since initial abandonment. 
We tested a range of simple model specifications, including linear and log transformations of both *proportion* and *time*.
Due to a linear relationship between model residuals and time when including only one term for *time*, also tested models containing multiple *time* predictor terms, including log and linear terms.
Importantly, we also include *cohort* fixed effects, allowing for the estimation of unique coefficients for each cohort of abandoned land.

We compared the quality of each model using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values and chose the highest performing model specification, which predicted *proportion* with one log-transformed and one linear term of *time* since abandonment (see Figure \@ref(fig:AIC) and Equation \@ref(eq:mod-spec)).

Model assumptions were tested through visual inspection of fitted values vs. residuals plots and qq plots.
Full details are contained in Section \@ref(mod-AIC-diag).
All analyses were conducted RStudio version `r rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version`, using `r R.Version()$version.string`. 

### Translating decay rates into a weighted mean abandonment length

Is it possible to translate decay rates into an average length of time abandoned?
This would require an assumption about the amount of land being abandoned in a given year (or would this cancel out?).

```{r decay-to-length, eval = FALSE, include = FALSE}
# What do I need to do to figure this out?
# have cohorts, and the 

# assumption 0.
# all land is abandoned at the beginning:


# simplest assumption, the same amount of land is abandoned each year



lapply(1:15, FUN = function(i) {5000*0.7})

data.frame(year = 1991:2015,
           initial_area = 5000,
           half_life = 0.7
           ) %>% 
  mutate(area_remaining)

```


## Predicting length of abandonment and recultivation

Question: what factors best predict abandonment trajectories?
    3a. What predicts which pieces of land are abandoned for the longest periods of time? In other words, are some areas more likely to experience more durable abandonment?
        i. Predicting the *max age* of a pixel [or *age in 2017*] using spatial predictor variables like population, slope, elevation, soil, etc.
    3b. What predicts recultivation? Are less suitable lands recultivated more quickly? Are more recently abandoned lands more frequently recultivated? In other words, does the probability that a piece of abandoned land will be recultivated depend on how long it has been abandoned for?
        i. My sense, from the abandonment decay plots, is that the longer a piece of land is abandoned for (i.e. the greater the greater the *age*), the less likely it is to be recultivated. This will involve predicting recultivation with factors like current age of abandonment, and the other variables included in the primary regression, etc. How will I signify "recultivation" in the dataset? Options include:
            A. data for each transition, each transition from abandoned -> not_abandoned is pulled out, and the age is recorded. This will require some fancy DT wrangling.
            B. all periods of abandonment, including instances when abandoned land remains abandoned (and the age it is), with the cohort, the year, the age, etc.). Each year after a piece of land is defined as abandoned. So, let's say I have a pixel that is in 1995 and stays abandoned for a total of 12 years. This would result in 9 total observations.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
example_df <- data.frame(cohort = 1995,
           year = 2000:2012,
           age = 5:17,
           abn = c(rep("yes", 8), rep("no", 5)),
           recultivated = c(rep("no", 8), rep("yes", 5)))

Extra results:  
- Primary post-abandonment land uses. What is formerly abandoned land typically used for? What is the most common land use immediately after abandonment ends? What are the most common land uses of formerly abandoned land at the end of the time series? [Put things into bins: abandoned -> crop, non-crop, urban, and assess frequencies.] May not be all that exciting, since most of the land is likely put into agricultural land. But, worth looking into.

## Abandonment persistence and decay

Result in text: interpreting the decay plots to understand, on average, what proportion of abandoned land remains abandoned long-term (e.g. >20 years): this is simply looking at the 20 year mark, and noting the proportion remaining at that point. (on average, this ranges between about 67% for Shaanxi and 5% for Orenburg. Most sites cluster around 50%.)
