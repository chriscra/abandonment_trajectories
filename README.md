What we do...

This is a living repository. See the public release and Zenodo archive for the code used at time of publication. 

## Components of this repository

This repository has one primary directory housing the scripts used in our analysis. 
Datasets that underly this analysis are published on Zenodo at (), along with the primary abandonment duration datasets generated during the analysis that support our findings.


The five primary `.Rmd` scripts are numbered based on the order in which parts of the analysis were conducted. Note that these `.Rmd` scripts are intended to be run interactively chunk by chunk (sometimes line by line), not knit together all at once. They also include code for data visualization and exploratory data analysis; not all code is strictly required. These files include:

A list of the scripts

- **1_Start.Rmd** serves as a useful working starting place, loading required packages, custom functions, and useful GIS components. This script was originally meant for development, and is not strictly necessary for reproducing the analysis.
- **2_BD_input_prep.Rmd** outlines

Within the "scripts" directly live two other directories: "cluster" and "util":
